# Studying-Epidemics
A Research Paper for the course project of Complex Adaptive Systems WiSe 2020/2021 by Prof. Dr. Köhler-Bußmeier.

## Purpose
In this Researh Paper I set out to better understand the growth of the COVID-19 Pandemic in my home country, while learning more about Epidemics and SIR Models, which was part of the course.

## Libraries Used
I used Python for this research, and took advantage of the CovsirPhy library, which you can read more about [here](https://lisphilar.github.io/covid19-sir/index.html)  
I took advantage of it to run the simulations for me and give me a lot of information regarding growth, parameter estimation, ODE calculations and much more.  
It also was massively helpful in the sense that it outputs .csv and .jpg files of what you are simulating so it let me extrapolate the .csv data as I wished.
